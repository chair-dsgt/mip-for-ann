# Identify critical neurons using Mixed Integer Programming

A novel way of computing neuron importance score at fully connected layers and using these computed scores to prune non-critical neurons with marginal loss in the accuracy without fine tuning or retraining .

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Install the requirements 

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## MIP Solver
We use Commercial Mosek, In order to run experiments you will need to have a license file /root/mosek for ubuntu mosek.lic .
To use another solver open training/sparsify_model.py #94 and change solver=cp.Mosek to the solver you have (CVXPY is just a wrapper on top of multiple solvers)

## Running the experiments

All the experiments reported in the paper are in experiments_notebook.ipynb

## Training Models
    $ python3 train_model.py 
### Arguments
- -sd : parent directory to store logs and models
- -e  : number of training epochs
- -dl : dataset index to be used for training with the following order ['MNIST', 'FashionMNIST', 'KMNIST', 'Caltech256', 'CIFAR10'] 
- -r  : number of training reset to train multiple models with different initializations
- -m  : model index with the following order ['FullyConnectedBaselineModel', 'FullyConnected2Model', 'Lecun Model 98', 'Dense Fully Connected', 'Lenet', 'vgg19']
- -op : optimizer used for training with the following order ['Adam', 'SGD', 'RMSPROP']
- -l  : learning rate index with the following order ['1e-1', '1e-2', '1e-3', '1e-5']
- -bs : batch size used during training

## Sparsifying Models
    $ python3 sparsify.py
### Arguments
starts with same arguments as training to select the right experiment directory with the following extra arguments
- -tt : pruning threshold (neurons having an importance score below the threshold will be pruned)
- -sw : \lambda used to control loss on accuracy (more weight will prune less to keep predictive capacity)
- -ft : flag to enable fine tuning after pruning
- -te : number of fine tuning epochs

## Verification Experiment
    $ python3  verify_selected_data.py
with same arguments as sparsifying models to plot the pruning percentage and the accuracy changes when the batch of images fed to the MIP changes

## Different Lambdas Experiments
    $ python3 plot_different_lambdas
with same arguments as sparsifying models to plot the pruning percentage and the accuracy changes when the value of lambda -sw changes with same input batch to the MIP
